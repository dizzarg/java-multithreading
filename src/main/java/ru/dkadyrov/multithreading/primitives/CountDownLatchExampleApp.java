/**
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch} works in latch principle,
 * the main thread will wait until the gate is open. One thread waits
 * for n threads, specified while creating the CountDownLatch.
 *
 * Any thread, usually the main thread of the application, which calls
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch#await()}  will wait until count reaches zero
 * or it's interrupted by another thread. All other threads are required to count down
 * by calling {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch#countDown()}
 * once they are completed or ready.
 *
 * As soon as count reaches zero, the waiting thread continues.
 * One of the disadvantages/advantages of {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch} is
 * that it's not reusable: once count reaches zero
 * you cannot use {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch} any more.
